# Actor Wireframe Generator

Generate actor-based wireframe prototypes for your projects using Python and Matplotlib.

## Description

The `actor_wireframe_generator` is a simple and flexible module that allows users to visualize actor-based interfaces for their systems or projects. It's especially useful for system designers, developers, and architects to quickly draft and visualize interfaces based on different user roles and their associated functionalities.

## Features

- Generate wireframe prototypes based on actor roles and their components.
- Customize the title of the wireframe.
- Uses Matplotlib for visualization, ensuring high-quality output.

## Installation

1. Ensure you have Python installed.
2. Install required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install matplotlib
   ```

## Usage

1. Import the module:
   ```python
   from actor_wireframe_generator import generate_actor_wireframe
   ```

2. Define your actors and their associated components:
   ```python
   actor_data = {
       "Actor1": ["Component1", "Component2"],
       "Actor2": ["ComponentA", "ComponentB", "ComponentC"],
       # ... add as many actors and components as needed
   }
   ```

3. Generate the wireframe:
   ```python
   generate_actor_wireframe(actor_data, "Your Custom Title")
   ```

## Example

```python
from actor_wireframe_generator import generate_actor_wireframe

actors = {
    "Farmers": ["Dashboard", "Crop Management", "AI Recommendations"],
    "Consumers": ["Product Trace", "Feedback"],
    "Admins": ["User Management", "System Monitoring"]
}

generate_actor_wireframe(actors, "Agriculture System Interface")
```
